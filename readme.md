# Reddit MVP | WebDevASMR

We are going to develop an MVP (minimum viable product) clone of Reddit, using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Here are the steps we will follow to build this MVP:

- Add imports for dependencies such as fonts, icons etc.
- Write out the basic HTML structure for the home layout
- Create a modal that allows us to add a post and save it to localStorage
- Add functionality to display posts and allow voting on them
- Add a post detail page which shows the full post content
- Add functionality to allow commenting on a post, with nested comments

You can find the full written tutorial for this video and all others on WebDevASMR.com

Enjoy!
